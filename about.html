				<h2>Nice to Meet You ðŸ‘‹</h3>
					<br />
					<p>Based in LA and previously working at Zhangyue Technology, a company at the cutting edge of
						shaping the online reading market.</p>
					<br />
					<p>Born in China and got master degree from Landscape Architecture school at NCSU( North Carolina
						State
						University).</p>
					<br />
					<p>I became passionate about product design early in graduate school. I started my career working on
						a medical product platform. After returning to China, I worked on consumer-facing and
						financial products. I then moved on to a Top1 online reading company called Zhangyue. I led the
						design effort and shipped innovative updates
						to the iReader app - the Top 1 online reading app with 150 million MAU at Zhangyue Technologies.
						I love to bring reasonable design into
						peopleâ€˜s life and is adept at systematic thinking and RAPIDLY experimenting with different
						solutions based on my architecture background.
						I involved in research, product strategy, designing iterations and has helped launch a variety
						of app products to the public by working
						cross-functionally. The ability of learning and moving fast and my rich experiences in the
						product design industry make me strongly believe
						I will be adding value effectively to the design team.</p>
