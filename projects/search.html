                collabrorated with other designers, pm and engineers to brainstorming some board ideals, we choose
                character label and character name highlighted to deep dive into next step as they are really targeting
                in searching process. We don't moveforad with character name highlighted as book photos attract too much

                by the character with this key word. The label is iconified to facilitate users to locate the right
                search option. And with color coding, we can easily extend it to have more options to satisfy new
                searching requirement in future. Tapping on it will take users to the character search result page.</p>
            <p>Provide searching by character option in the top of the typeahead dropdown, tapping on it will open a new

            <p>Since we supported searching by Character Label, how do we associate the search results with it? Based on
                this,
                I came up with three different options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>option1: Put Character Label for all of the books.</li>
                <li>option2: Put Character Label next to the book name for each book.</li>
                <li>option3: Put character name within other assistant data, and highlight it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Option 1 has less strong connection between characters and books while Option 2 does not visually align
                very
                well as the length of book names could vary often times. Option 3 does not have these drawbacks, most
                imporantly, with highlighted text, users tend to read other assitant information which helps them better
                understand and make the decision. Thus we chose the Option 3 as the final design.</p>
